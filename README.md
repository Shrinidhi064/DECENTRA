# DECENTRACHEQUE

**DecentraCheque** is a decentralized smart cheque validation system that tackles key challenges in traditional processingâ€”such as OCR inaccuracies, fraud, and lack of transparency.  
By integrating **machine learning** for signature verification and **blockchain** for tamper-proof record-keeping, it ensures **secure**, **accurate**, and **transparent** cheque processing.

### Running the Application

#### Frontend
To start a simple HTTP server for the frontend:
```
python -m http.server 8000

```

#### Backend

```
python manage.py runserver 

```
### Smart Contract Commands

Make sure **Node.js** and **Truffle** are installed. Then use the following commands to initialize and deploy the smart contracts:

```bash
npm install -g truffle
truffle init
truffle compile
truffle migrate --network development
```

Refer requirements.txt to install python libraries for backend!
